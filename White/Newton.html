<h2>Isaac Newton by Andrew May</h2>
<h4>This is a super short book, and by no means is a whole biography of Newton's life and work.  I picked up this book because I wanted to find out about the creator of calculus and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, but I got so much more from this book. There are a few important bullet points that stuck in my head for a week after I read this book-</h4>
	<ol type="1">
<li>Newton lived in Cambridge for 37 years before he left it for the Royal Mint.</li>
<li>Sir Isaac was against counterfeiting, and arrested one of the leading counterfeiters of the time, Wiliam Chaloner.</li>
<li>He was a workaholic- when he was meeting his friends, he could walk into his study to get a bottle of wine, but get hit by an idea and start writing it down, forgetting his friends.</li>
<li>He didn't agree with Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who based his assumptions on "Common sense", and Isaac wrote in his textbook that "Aristotle is my friend, but truth is a bigger friend"</li>
