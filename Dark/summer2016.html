        <h4>Motorola announced their Moto Z.</h4>
        <p>The Z is a "modular" smartphone. The modules connect via a connector on the back. The phone itself is super thin, coming in at a mind-boggling 5.1mm. It has a huge camera bump, and Style Covers are available to customize the handset while getting rid of the bump. In my opinion, it is a step back from the exceptional design used in the 2014 model. The 2014 was filled with battery, and the backs were interchangeable not via a magnetic connector but via clasps. However, the modularity also allows for something called MotoMods, which are speakers, powerbanks or projectors clippable onto the magnetic port. Even though Motorola made it exceptionally easy to create MotoMods, I am skeptical of developers endeavoring to build them. Overall, this phone is a solid flagship, but is expensive. And oh, it doesn't ship until September.</p>

        <h4> OnePlus announced the 3.</h4>
            <p>The OnePlus 3 is the complete opposite of the Moto. It is a decent Android flagship available to buy for $399. It has the usual specs- Snapdragon 820, 6GB RAM (which, for the sake of the battery, is limited to much less) and a 5.5" 1080p screen. For $399, it is a great offer, even when you take into account that Google's VR program, Daydream, won't be supported.</p>

        <h4>Xiaomi unveiled the MiBand2, MiNotebook Air and Redmi Pro.</h4>
        <p>The MiBand is not very interesting. It is a Moore's Law evolution of the original Band. It now includes a screen, a HR monitor and the ability to unlock the MiNotebook Air.</p>

        <p>The MiNotebook Air are two different laptops. There is a 12.5" and a 13.3". The 13.3" is a powerhouse of a machine, as it has an Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM and an Nvidia GeForce 940MX. It costs approximately $750, which is a great deal for such machine. However, it runs on Windows 10, which, at least for me, is a con. Windows requires licensing fees, causing the overall computer price to go up. If Xiaomi used Linux, they could've shaved $50 off the final price.</p>

<p>The 12.5" is specced with an Intel Core m3 processor and 4GB RAM, and costs $525. It also runs on Windows 10, and is generally a OnePlus 3 in the laptop world.</p>

        <p>Xiaomi's Redmi Pro also features a 5.5" FHD screen, HelioX25 and either 3 or 4GB RAM. It has two cameras, and, at least in my opinion, it looks great. Its main superpower is Xiaomi's newfound ecosystem.</p>

        <h4>Nintendo showed off the NES Classic Edition.</h4>
        <p>The Classic Edition is a small NES for the 21st century. It features a HDMI port while keeping the original controller design. It comes with thirty games(some of which aren't great), and you can't buy more, but it costs $59.99, so it works out $4 per a great game. That's a deal!</p>

        <h4>Samsung rolled out the Note 7.</h4>
        <p>The Note 7 features a frigging iris scanner. It scans the user's eyes, which Samsung says is more secure than the standard fingerprint scanner. However, it is a massive 5.7" phone, and features the same insides as the S7 or S7Edge, and the S7 features a 5.2" and 5.5" screens, which fits in one's pocket better. The Note differentiates itself by including the S Pen. The S Pen is a stylus, but it also has additional features. For example, it can create a GIF from a short video clip, but not if the clip is DRM protected.</p>
