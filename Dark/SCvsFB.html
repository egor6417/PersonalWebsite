	<h4>Facebook vs Snapchat.</h4>
        <p>Facebook and Snapchat go back a long time. It started off with Facebook trying to buy Snapchat in 2013 for $3 000 000 000. That's a 3 with nine zeroes. That's a three multiplied by 10 to the 9th power. But Evan Spiegel, founder and CEO of Snapchat, rejected the offer.</p>

		<p>After that, Facebook produced a series of shameless Snapchat clones. There was Poke, Slingshot, Quick Updates and Bolt, but they all failed. However, Facebook is back at it again with Instagram Stories.</p>

		<p>Instagram Stories is a direct rip of Snapchat stories, perhaps the Snapchat feature people use the most. Heck, the only thing that's different is the transition between the slides. But, as multiple web celebrities already noted, Instagram Stories get a lot more engagement than those on Snapchat. Facebook was shameless in ripping off Snapchat, but they are ahead, and they have to do all they can to stay ahead and be the #1 social network compound. This principle is using game theory- if a yacht is #1, to stay #1, it only has to mimick yacht #2. Right now, Snapchat is social network #2. You can see where this is going.</p>

		<p>The only original thing left for Snapchat is filters. Filters are used in Snapchat stories a lot. They include overlays like geofilters, or filters that follow a subject, like the dog filter. Filters that follow a face is a them of a Belarussian startup MSQRD, which was recently acquired by Facebook. It is only a matter of time before an update with filters for Instagram Stories hits the app stores worldwide, and Facebook rolls out a mechanism to let users create geofilters, like Snapchat does.</p>

			<p>No matter what, teenagers like me are staying on Snapchat, but generations to come will probably go to Instagram. Or Instagram Stories will die. As did the clones before it.</p>

		<p>P.S. An analogy can be drawn here with Facebook vs Twitter in the earlier days. They were engaged in a quarrel, and Twitter is left only with its most patriotic users. Because of that, Twitter is a very focused place, and a nice network to be in. If Snapchat shares Twitter's fate, then it will be a bad thing business-wise, but a great thing patriotic-user-wise.</p>
